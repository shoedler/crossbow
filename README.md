Crossbow is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).
Its purpose is to improve the interconnectedness of your notes by providing suggestions for backlinks based on the notes in your vault.

## How to use

Just open the crossbow sidebar by clicking on the crossbow icon. All the suggestions will appear within the sidebar.

### Applying suggestions

Clicking on a suggestion in the sidebar will show you a list of occurences of the word in the current note.
Clicking on one of the occurences will show you a list of links (matches) that you can apply to the word. These matches
are ranked, based on the quality of the match.

You can apply a match by clicking the appropriate icon next to the match:

which will insert the following link:
